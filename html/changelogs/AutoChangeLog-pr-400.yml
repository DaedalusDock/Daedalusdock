changes:
  - bugfix: Items getting knocked off (glasses and cigars), bad omens, and spaghetti
      falling from pockets should trigger on most knockdowns again like they used
      to.
  - code_imp: Cleaned up the knockoff component a bit. Also unit tests it.
  - bugfix: Frozen stuff is now properly actually recognized as frozen and won't re-freeze.
  - bugfix: Tonic Water heals dizziness instead of causing it
  - bugfix: Fixes stuttered words with anxiety being capitalized
