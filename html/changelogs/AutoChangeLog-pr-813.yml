changes:
  - bugfix: Fingerprints are now applied in more situations. Did you know that punching
      someone didn't apply fingerprints?
  - bugfix: Fingerprints are now applied more realistically, attempting to add to
      clothing first where applicable.
  - bugfix: Blood is now left on items you touch if your hands or gloves are bloody.
  - bugfix: Tracking blood on feet/shoes works correctly.
  - refactor: Rewrote the forensics component into a datum.
  - rscadd: Two new forensic information classes, Trace DNA and Gunshot Residue. Trace
      DNA is left by doing things such as biting, smoking a cigarette, or drinking.
      Gunshot Residue is left by ballistic firearms.
  - rscadd: Fingerprints are now only partially left, sometimes requiring multiple
      touches to give full clarity to the print.
  - rscadd: Blood can now be colors other than red.
  - rscadd: There is more blood.

      crew member's record when they joined.
  - qol: Cleaned up evidence bag behavior to be in line with other storage objects.
  - rscadd: Added sample kits for different forensic information. Fingerprint cards
      for fingerprints, swabs for trace DNA or blood DNA, a fiber kit for material
      fibers, and finger print powder for finding fingerprints on objects.
  - rscadd: Scene cards to mark crime scenes.
  - rscadd: Detective now gets an Electron Microscope, to analyze fingerprints, fibers,
      and residue.
  - refactor: Rewrote the Forensic Scanner into the DNA Scanner. It is now only used
      for trace DNA and blood DNA samples.
