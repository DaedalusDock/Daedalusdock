  Comxy:
  - bugfix: When holding plasma glass, the sprite of normal glass was shown in hand
      since plasma glass in hand didn't exist.
  - rscadd: Added titanium and plastitanium glass shards as well as spears and shivs
      for their types, including plasma glass shivs.
  - imageadd: Sprites for plasma, titanium and plastitanium glass shards when hold
      in hand.
  - qol: titanium and plastitanium glass having their own shards makes sense, and
      is a quality feature.

  - rscadd: You can now reinforce plating to protect your department from the troublemakers
      upstairs. Station builders might find these useful to put the stations most
      secure locations on the lower floors.
  - imageadd: added sprites for reinforced plating
  - code_imp: RCD proofing has been variablized and can now be applied to any floor
      type instead of just reinforced floors.
