  - qol: Updated darkmode colors for goon chat.
  Kapu1178, LemonInTheDark, ShizCalev, Mooshimi, KylerAce, JohnFulpWillard:
  - refactor: Connection Edges made about 50x cheaper while sleeping.
  - qol: When ventcrawling, rather then jumping between pipes, your view will "glide"
  - qol: When ventcrawling, holding two directions no longer locks you in place. Instead
      behaving as expected
  - qol: Ventcrawling now darkens the background while you're doing it. Hopefully
      this looks slightly better then the fullbright of current.
  - code_imp: Ventcrawling code has had a 99% performance increase. I am not joking.
      Won't lag the server anymore.
  - code_imp: Atmos geometry resolution is up to 25% faster.
